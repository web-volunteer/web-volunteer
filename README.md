## Functionalities

The user can sign up and then log in either as a web developer or as a project owner, each path offering different functionalities. Each user can edit their profile.

Project owners can create, edit and delete several projects. Web developers willing to volunteer may browse all projects and apply for as many projects as they like. 

The project owner will see all applicants and has the choice to accept or reject each. In case a web dev got accepted, they will see this in their account and the project's status will change from open to running. 

Each user has a page with their projects - either which they created or which they applied to.
